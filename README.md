## Features

### Authentication
- Sign up with your details to create an account.  
- Secure login to track interview history and progress.

- Configure your session:
  - Role you’re applying for  
  - Experience level  
  - Interview type (Technical, Behavioral, or Mixed)

  - **Overall Impression score** (e.g., 2/100)  
  - **Interview date & time**  
  - **Detailed breakdown** of:
    - Communication  
    - Problem-Solving  
    - Technical Knowledge  
    - Behavioral Skills

## System Architecture Overview

> Below are the architecture notes describing how PulseAI processes voice conversations, evaluates answers, and stores interview results.


### High Level Architecture


> User → Vapi Voice Agent → Backend API → Gemini LLM → Firestore DB → Back to User

### Interview Conversation Workflow

<img width="308" height="904" alt="Voice Agent Workflow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a3201ad-8db7-4e1c-b0c6-db142df946a1" />

## Agent Intelligence & Persona Handling

PulseAI goes beyond basic Q&A by adapting to different user behaviors:

| Persona Type | Agent Response |
|-------------|----------------|
| Confused User | Guides with role suggestions & clarifying questions |
| Efficient User | Shorter interviews, direct questions, less small talk |
| Chatty User | Acknowledges but steers conversation back to topic |
| Edge Case User | Handles impossible or off-topic requests politely |

> Each response is generated based on the user's intent and interview progress.

## Design Decisions & Reasoning

- Chose **voice-first** approach to improve realism and confidence building
- Used **Gemini** for detailed interview scoring and follow-up logic
- **Firestore** stores all interview history to track progress over time
- Stateless computing through serverless Firebase Functions for scalability
- Minimal UI, optimized for quick practice sessions
